CISC 275 Notes

Iterator:
Collection c = ...
c.iterator() -> contains next() hasNext() and remove()
They are replacing for loops because for loops can cause index+1 errors which is when you walk off the end of the list.
How to add to an iterator: call the iterators add method. Ex: cIter.add(x)
Collections:
2 big subgroups- sets and lists(each has multiple implementations under it), lists are ordered, sets are not ordered.
From exercise, for collection (problem 3 i think): Collection <Dog> pack = new ArrayList<Dog>(3);
We want to write as general as possible so we can choose what kind of collection we or the user wants to use later
Angled brackets specify the objects that the collection can hold. If the brackets are not there then you can have the collection hold any objects. Ex: Collection pack is the same thing as Collection<Object> pack.
Every collection has a toString method because all Objects in java have toString methods whether or not we actually write them ourselves.
Any object we make inherits everything from Object
Everything in Java is Poymorphic. (polymorphism)
